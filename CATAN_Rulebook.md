# CATAN - The Game Rulebook

## INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the unexplored island of Catan!

As you and your fellow explorers gaze across the uninhabited landscape of hexagonal tracts of terrain, you quickly realize that this unique land arrangement provides ample space for each of you to put down roots.

You race off to establish your respective communities by gathering resources from nearby terrain, building your infrastructure, and nurturing trade relationships. Watch out for surprisesâ€”your rivals can block your path or send the robber to plunder your wealth!

Good luck, explorers!

## SETUP

### Fixed Setup (for your first game)

1. **Assemble the Frame:** Match the numbers at the puzzle piece ends of the sea frame pieces to assemble the coast of Catan.
2. **Place the Hexes and Number Discs:** Place the terrain hexes and number discs inside the frame as shown in the rulebook.
3. **Create the Supply:** Sort the resource cards by type and place them in five faceup stacks. Shuffle the development cards and place them facedown. Place the Longest Route and Largest Army tiles near the game board.
4. **Place the Robber and Player Pieces:** Place the robber on the desert hex. Each player chooses a color and takes their roads, settlements, and cities.
5. **Collect Your Starting Resources:** Each player takes the resource cards for the hexes adjacent to their second settlement.
6. **Choose the First Player:** Each player rolls the dice. The player with the highest roll is the first player.

### Variable Setup (for experienced players)

1. **Assemble the Frame:** Shuffle and connect the puzzle piece ends of the sea frame pieces.
2. **Place the Hexes:** Randomly place the hexes face up inside the frame.
3. **Place the Number Discs:** Arrange the discs face down and place them counterclockwise on the hexes, skipping the desert. Then turn them over.
4. **Place the Robber:** Place the robber on the desert hex.
5. **Create the Supply:** Same as in the Fixed Setup.
6. **Choose the First Player:** Same as in the Fixed Setup.
7. **Place Your Starting Pieces:**
   - **Round 1:** Starting with the first player, each player places 1 settlement and 1 adjacent road.
   - **Round 2:** Starting with the last player and going in reverse order, each player places a second settlement and an adjacent road.
8. **Collect Your Starting Resources:** Each player takes 1 matching resource card for each hex adjacent to their second settlement.

## TURN OVERVIEW

A turn consists of two phases:

1. **Production Phase**
2. **Action Phase**

### Production Phase

1. **Play a Development Card (optional):** You may play one development card before rolling the dice.
2. **Roll Dice:** The sum of the dice determines which hexes produce resources.
3. **Collect Resources:** Players with settlements or cities on producing hexes collect resource cards.
   - A settlement produces 1 resource card.
   - A city produces 2 resource cards.
4. **Resolve a 7:** If you roll a 7:
   - **Discard Resources:** Any player with more than 7 resource cards must discard half (rounded down).
   - **Activate the Robber:** Move the robber to a new hex and steal 1 random resource card from a player with a building on that hex. The new hex with the robber does not produce resources.

### Action Phase

You may perform these actions as often as you like and in any order.

#### Trade

- **Trade with Other Players:** Announce what you want and what you are willing to trade. Other players can make counteroffers.
- **General Trade with the Supply (4:1):** Trade 4 of the same resource cards to the supply for 1 resource card of your choice.
- **Port Trade with the Supply (3:1 or 2:1):** If you have a building on a port, you can trade with the supply at a better rate.

#### Build

Spend resources to build roads, settlements, cities, or buy development cards.

- **Road:** Costs 1 brick, 1 wood. Must connect to one of your existing roads or buildings.
- **Settlement:** Costs 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wool, 1 wheat. Worth 1 VP. Must be placed on an empty intersection and be at least two edges away from any other building (The Distance Rule).
- **City:** Costs 2 wheat, 3 ore. Worth 2 VPs. Replaces one of your existing settlements.
- **Development Card:** Costs 1 ore, 1 wool, 1 wheat.

#### Development Cards

- You can play 1 development card per turn.
- You cannot play a development card on the same turn you bought it (except for Victory Point cards).
- **Knight:** Move the robber. The first player to play 3 Knight cards gets the **Largest Army** tile (2 VPs).
- **Victory Point:** Reveals 1 VP. Can be played at any time, even on the turn you buy it.
- **Road Building:** Build 2 roads at no cost.
- **Invention:** Take any 2 resource cards from the supply.
- **Monopoly:** Announce one resource type. All other players must give you all of their resource cards of that type.

## WINNING THE GAME

The first player to reach **10 or more VPs** on their turn wins the game immediately.

3. The paired players turn

### Additional Components for 5-6 Players

- **11 terrain hexes:**
  - 2x forests
  - 2x pastures
  - 2x fields
  - 2x hills
  - 2x mountains
  - 1x desert
- **28 number discs**
- **25 resource cards:**
  - 5x brick
  - 5x wood
  - 5x wool
  - 5x wheat

  - 1x Monopoly
  - 1x Road Building
  - 1x Invention
- **2 sets of player pieces (brown and green)**
- **4 sea frame pieces**
- **2 player aids**
- **2 paired player markers**

### Setup for 5-6 Players

#### Fixed Setup

1. **Assemble the Frame:** Take the four small frame pieces from CATAN 5-6 and insert them between the larger CATAN frame pieces.
2. **Place the Hexes and Number Discs:** Place the terrain hexes and number discs inside the frame as shown in the 5-6 player rulebook.
3. **Create the Supply:** Shuffle the 25 resource cards and 9 development cards into their respective decks from CATAN.
4. **Complete the Setup:** In a 5-player game, one color is not used. Take 1 road piece of each color. Players take turns randomly drawing one of those road pieces. The final road piece is the color that is not used. Place the settlements of that color on the board without roads.
5. **Choose the First Player:** Each player rolls the dice. The player with the highest roll is the first player and receives the player 1 marker. The third person to the left of the starting player receives the player 2 marker.

#### Variable Setup

1. **Assemble the Frame:** Shuffle the sea frame pieces from CATAN and the four small frame pieces from CATAN 5-6. Insert the smaller pieces between the larger CATAN frame pieces.
2. **Place the Hexes:** Randomly place the terrain hexes face up inside the frame.
3. **Place the Number Discs:** Arrange the discs face down in A-B-C order, ending in Za-Zb-Zc. Starting in any corner of the board, place the number discs on the hexes counterclockwise, skipping both deserts. Then turn them over so the number side is face up.
4. **Create the Supply:** Shuffle the 25 resource cards and 9 development cards into their respective decks from CATAN.
5. **Complete the Setup:** The first player receives the player 1 marker. The third person to the left of the first player receives the player 2 marker.

### Rules for 5-6 Players

A turn consists of three phases, which occur in this order:

1. **Player 1: Production Phase**
2. **Player 1: Action Phase**
3. **Player 2: Action Phase**

Once player 2 has finished their Action phase, if the game hasn't ended yet, pass the dice and the player markers to the left. The new player 1 begins their turn with the Production phase.

#### Rules Change for Paired Players

Player 1 takes their turn exactly as they would in a game of CATAN. If player 1 does not win on their turn, then player 2 takes an Action phase with one restriction: **Player 2 may not trade with other players**. All other actions remain the same.

If player 2 reaches 10 VPs during their part of the paired player turn, the game ends immediately, and they win.
